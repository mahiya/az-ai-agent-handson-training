# Deployment of Azure Resources
In this training, you will eventually deploy and use the following Azure resources.

| Azure Service               | Purpose |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Azure Storage               | Storage for holding the source PDF files that will be used to populate the index of Azure AI Search, and also for use by Azure AI Foundry. |
| Azure AI Search             | Retriever for the RAG process in the implemented AI agent. |
| Azure AI Foundry - Hub      | Hub (group) for AI Projects. |
| Azure AI Foundry - Project  | AI agent development using Azure AI Agent Service. |
| Azure Application Insights  | Tracing for Azure AI Agent Service usage. |
| Azure Key Vault             | Storage for authentication information for service connections registered in AI Hub and Project. |
| Azure App Service           | Host for the web application that interacts with the AI agent. |

By deploying Azure Storage, Azure AI Search, and Azure AI Foundry (Hub/Project), you will have most of the necessary resources in place. The Azure App Service will be created later via the Azure CLI.

In this session, to help you become familiar with operations in the Azure Portal, you will primarily create each Azure resource using GUI operations. However, Azure also provides services such as [Azure Resource Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) and [Azure Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep) to enable Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Additionally, deploying Azure resources using [Terraform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/overview) is also common.

## Deployment of Azure Storage
First, we will create an Azure Storage account to store the data for processing by Azure AI Search. Azure Storage includes four services: an object storage service called ```Blob```, a messaging queuing service called ```Queue```, a simple key-value store type table service called ```Table```, and a file storage service with SMB/NFS protocol compatibility called ```File```. In this case, we will use the ```Blob``` service (often referred to as Azure Blob Storage). Blob storage can integrate with a vast number of Azure services and is one of the core services in Azure.

First, go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and click on ```[All services]``` in the side menu. Then, click on ```[Storage]``` within the categories in the side menu of the window that appears, and then click on ```[Create]``` in ```Storage Account```.

![Deployment of Azure Storage](images/1.deploy-resources/1.storage/1.png)

A screen for creating a Storage account will be displayed. First, ensure that the appropriate resource group is selected in ```[Resource Group]```. Then, enter a value for ```[Storage Account Name]```. Please note that you cannot use symbols such as hyphens in the name and it must be globally unique. It is preferable that the ```[Region]``` be one that is near the Azure AI Search account that will utilize the data (one of "East US", "West US 2", "North Central US", or "West Euro"), but any region is acceptable. Once all settings are complete, click the ```[Review + Create]``` button.

![Deployment of Azure Storage](images/1.deploy-resources/1.storage/3.png)

A review screen for creating the Storage account is displayed. Review the details, and then click the ```[Create]``` button to begin the creation process.

## Deployment of Azure AI Search
Next, create an Azure AI Search account to serve as the search index used as a Retriever when performing text generation via RAG in the implemented AI agent.

![Overview of Azure AI Search](images/99.others/ai-search.png)

Click on ```[All services]``` in the side menu. Then, within the categories of the window that appears, click on ```[AI + Machine Learning]``` and click ```[Create]``` button in ```[AI Search]``` from the displayed Azure services.

![Deployment of Azure AI Search](images/1.deploy-resources/2.ai-search/1.png)

A screen for creating an AI Search account is displayed. First, ensure that the resource group for this session is selected in ```[Resource Group]```. Then, enter a value for ```[Service Name]```. While you can use symbols such as hyphens in the name, please note that it must be globally unique. For ```[Region]```, choose one of "East US", "West US 2", "North Central US", or "West Euro". As of 2025/4/14, the Azure AI Search [Document Layout Skill](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-document-intelligence-layout) that you will be using is in preview and is only available in certain regions. Once all settings are complete, click the ```[Change Pricing Tier]``` link to review the available pricing tiers.

![Deployment of Azure AI Search](images/1.deploy-resources/2.ai-search/3.png)

Review the available pricing tiers. There are pricing tier (SKU) categories such as "Free", "Basic", "Standard", and "Storage Optimized". Each SKU differs in terms of "Storage size (documents/vectors)", "Number of indexes that can be created", "Number of indexers that can be created", "Maximum number of scale units/replicas/partitions", and "Price". The scale unit is the product of [Number of replicas] Ã— [Number of partitions]. The price shown on the screen is the monthly cost per scale unit, so the monthly cost for this account will be the [scale unit count] multiplied by the [cost]. Below is an example of the calculation.

![Azure AI Search Scale Units (SU)](images/99.others/ai-search-su.png)

Increasing the number of partitions increases the storage size and QPS (queries per second). Increasing the number of replicas boosts the QPS, and having 2 or more replicas applies a 99.9% SLA for read availability, while 3 or more applies a 99.9% SLA for write availability (note that with only one replica, even read availability does not receive an SLA).

"Free" is intended for trial purposes, "Basic" is for development environments, and "Standard" is suitable for most development or production scenarios. "Storage Optimized" is used when the volume of stored documents is exceptionally large (on the order of billions). A critical point to note is that after creating the account, you can scale out within a given SKU, but you cannot change the SKU (i.e., scale up). In other words, while you can increase storage size and QPS in an S1 plan by increasing the number of replicas or partitions, you cannot switch to an S2 or L1 plan to address higher demands. Additionally, if a skillset calls external services via a private endpoint, note that you must use an S2 or S3 plan.

In this case, we will use the ```S1``` plan. Once you have reviewed the available pricing tiers, click the ```[Select]``` button.

![Deployment of Azure AI Search](images/1.deploy-resources/2.ai-search/4.png)

After returning to the previous screen, click the ```[Next: Scaling]``` button. A screen for setting the number of replicas and partitions for the AI Search account is displayed. As mentioned above, if the number of replicas remains at the default value of "1", a 99.9% SLA for read availability will not be applied. Therefore, if you are using this in a production environment, it is recommended to have at least 2 replicas. Click the ```[Review + Create]``` button.

![Deployment of Azure AI Search](images/1.deploy-resources/2.ai-search/5.png)

Review the AI Search account configuration. Once you have confirmed the details, click the ```[Create]``` button to begin the creation process.

## Deployment of Azure AI Hub
In this instance, we will create the Hub and Project of Azure AI Foundry in order to develop AI agents using the foundational models of Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Agent Service. When using services such as OpenAI Service or AI Search from the AI Agent Service, the connection details registered in AI Hub or AI Project are used (with the corresponding authentication information stored in Azure Key Vault). This setup allows you to register connection details in the AI Hub and have them utilized by multiple underlying AI Projects. Hence, the AI Hub can be considered a group for AI Projects. AI Projects are intended to be created on a real-world project basis, as they serve as units for AI Agent Service, trace information, and LLM evaluation management.

Click on ```[All services]``` in the side menu. Then, within the categories of the window that appears, click on ```[AI + Machine Learning]``` and select ```[Azure AI Foundry]``` from the displayed Azure services.

![Deployment of Azure AI Hub](images/1.deploy-resources/3.ai-hub/1.png)

A page is displayed showing a list of Azure AI Hubs or Projects that the logged-in user can view within the currently selected Entra tenant. To create a new AI Hub, click on the ```[+ Create]``` button at the top of the page, and then click on ```[Hub]```.

![Deployment of Azure AI Hub](images/1.deploy-resources/3.ai-hub/2.png)

A screen for creating an AI Hub is displayed. First, ensure that the resource group for this session is selected in ```[Resource Group]```. For the ```[Region]```, select ```East US``` because many AI models are more easily accessible there. Then, enter a value for ```[Name]```. Also, check the option ```[Same as hub resource group]``` under the default project resource group setting. This setting determines which resource group the Azure resources required by the AI Hub will be deployed to; in this case, we have chosen to use the same resource group as the AI Hub. Once all settings are complete, click the ```[Next: Storage]``` button.

![Deployment of Azure AI Hub](images/1.deploy-resources/3.ai-hub/3.png)

In the ```[Storage Account]``` field, select the Storage account you created earlier. Then, click on the ```[Create new]``` link for the ```Application Insights``` section.

![Deployment of Azure AI Hub](images/1.deploy-resources/3.ai-hub/4.png)

Enter a desired ```[Name]``` for the Azure Application Insights instance to be created, and click the ```[Save]``` button. This is used for monitoring (logging) the operation of the AI Agent.

![Deployment of Azure AI Hub](images/1.deploy-resources/3.ai-hub/5.png)

Return to the previous screen and click the ```[Review + Create]``` button.

![Deployment of Azure AI Hub](images/1.deploy-resources/3.ai-hub/6.png)

Review the AI Hub configuration. Once you have confirmed the details, click the ```[Create]``` button.

![Deployment of Azure AI Hub](images/1.deploy-resources/3.ai-hub/7.png)

Wait until the creation (deployment) of the AI Hub is complete, and when the completion screen is displayed, click the ```[Go to resource]``` button.

![Deployment of Azure AI Hub](images/1.deploy-resources/3.ai-hub/8.png)

## Deployment of Azure AI Project
The page for the created AI Hub is now displayed. Click the ```[+ Create project]``` button in the top menu of the page.

![Deployment of Azure AI Project](images/1.deploy-resources/4.ai-project/1.png)

A screen for adding an AI Project to the AI Hub is displayed. First, enter a value for ```[Name]```. The ```Hub``` should already be set to the AI Hub you created earlier. Then, click the ```[Review + Create]``` button.

![Deployment of Azure AI Project](images/1.deploy-resources/4.ai-project/2.png)

Review the AI Project configuration. Once you have confirmed the details, click the ```[Create]``` button.

![Deployment of Azure AI Project](images/1.deploy-resources/4.ai-project/3.png)

Wait for the creation (deployment) of the AI Project to complete, and once the completion screen is displayed, click the ```[Go to resource]``` button.

![Deployment of Azure AI Project](images/1.deploy-resources/4.ai-project/4.png)

The page for the created AI Project is now displayed. Click the [Launch Studio] button to navigate to the Azure AI Foundry Portal.

![Deployment of Azure AI Project](images/1.deploy-resources/4.ai-project/5.png)

The Azure AI Foundry Portal is displayed with the project screen for the AI Project you created earlier. To deploy the models from the OpenAI Service that will be used in this training, click on ```[Model + Endpoints]``` in the side menu.

![Deployment of Azure AI Project](images/1.deploy-resources/4.ai-project/6.png)

A list of models deployed in this AI Project is displayed. Click the ```[+ Deploy Model]``` button at the top of the screen, and then click on ```[Deploy a Basic Model]```.

![Deployment of Azure AI Project](images/1.deploy-resources/4.ai-project/7.png)

A window will be displayed for selecting the model to deploy. Here, you can choose from models in the Azure AI Foundry model catalog, which includes models available on Azure OpenAI Service. Since a large number of models may be displayed, filter the list by entering ```gpt-4o``` into the search box. This will display either ```gpt-4o``` or ```gpt-4o-mini```, so select one of them and click the ```[Review]``` button.

![Deployment of Azure AI Project](images/1.deploy-resources/4.ai-project/8.png)

The model deployment settings screen is displayed. Keep the [Deployment Name] as the default (either gpt-4o or gpt-4o-mini), ensure that ```[Deployment Type]``` is set to ```Global Standard```, and then click the ```[Customize]``` button.

![Deployment of Azure AI Project](images/1.deploy-resources/4.ai-project/9.png)

Here, you can configure the model version and rate limits. Setting the rate limits is very important; if they are set too low, you may quickly hit the rate limit when using the service. On the other hand, since the total token rate limit that can be set is subject to a maximum quota per Azure subscription, if you set the maximum limit in a single deployment, it may prevent other developers using that Azure subscription from setting any rate limits at all. In this case, we will set the ```[Tokens per Minute Rate Limit]``` to ```40K```. Then, click the ```[Deploy]``` button to complete the deployment of the GPT model.

![Deployment of Azure AI Project](images/1.deploy-resources/4.ai-project/10.png)

Similarly, deploy the text embedding model "text-embedding-3-large". Select ```text-embedding-3-large``` and click the ```[Review]``` button.

![Deployment of Azure AI Project](images/1.deploy-resources/4.ai-project/11.png)

Similarly, set the ```[Tokens per Minute Rate Limit]``` to ```40K```. Then, click the ```[Deploy]``` button to complete the deployment of the GPT model.
