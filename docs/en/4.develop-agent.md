# Development of AI Agents with Azure AI Agent Service
Using the Azure AI Agent Service, we will develop an AI agent. First, we perform the preparatory steps, then implement the process that calls the AI Agent Service based on a provided Python program. Finally, we implement a chat application and deploy it to Azure Web Apps.

## Preparatory Steps

### Obtaining the AI Project Connection String
Display the resource group page and click on the name of the AI Project (the resource with type ```Azure AI project```) that you created earlier from the list of Azure resources.

![Obtaining the AI Project Connection String](images/4.develop-agent/1.png)

The AI Project page you clicked on will be displayed. To move to the Azure AI Foundry Portal, click the ```[Launch Studio]``` button.

![Obtaining the AI Project Connection String](images/4.develop-agent/2.png)

The AI Project page in the AI Foundry Portal is now displayed. Click on ```[Overview]``` in the side menu, then click the ```[Square Icon]``` on the right side of ```[Project Details] > [Project Connection String]``` to copy the AI Project connection string to your clipboard.

![Obtaining the AI Project Connection String](images/4.develop-agent/3.png)

Run the following command to copy the file [src/.env_template](../src/.env_template) and create the file ```src/.env```:

```bash
cp src/.env_template src/.env
```

Then, paste the AI Project connection string you copied into the value of ```PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING``` in the .env file as shown below:

```bash
# Azure AI Project Settings
PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING="{REGION}.api.azureml.ms;{SUBSCRIPTION_ID};{RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME};{AI_PROJECT_NAME}"
AI_SEARCH_CONNECTION_NAME="{Input your AI Search Connection Name in AI Project}"
OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOY_NAME="gpt-4o" # gpt-4o or gpt-4o-mini
```

### Adding Connected Resources to the AI Project
Next, configure the connection to the Azure AI Search account that you prepared earlier in the AI Project. 

Click on ```[Management Center]``` in the side menu.

![Adding Connected Resources to the AI Project](images/4.develop-agent/4.png)

The management center for AI Hub and the project is displayed. Here, you mainly manage users and connected resources. Click on ```[Connected resources]``` in the side menu to view the list of resources connected to the project, then click on ```[＋New Connection]```.

![Adding Connected Resources to the AI Project](images/4.develop-agent/5.png)

A window for adding resource connections will appear. Click on ```[Azure AI Search]```.

![Adding Connected Resources to the AI Project](images/4.develop-agent/6.png)

A list of AI Search accounts that can be connected is displayed. Click the ```[Add Connection]``` button for the AI Search account you created. Once the connection is added, click the ```[Close]``` button.

![Adding Connected Resources to the AI Project](images/4.develop-agent/7.png)

Verify that the AI Search account you selected has been added. Copy this name (the resource connection name) (in the example below it is "ragagenthandson250401") and paste it into the ```AI_SEARCH_CONNECTION_NAME``` value in the ```src/.env``` file. Also, adjust the value of ```OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOY_NAME``` according to the name of the GPT model you will use.

![Adding Connected Resources to the AI Project](images/4.develop-agent/8.png)

```bash
# Azure AI Project Settings
PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING="{REGION}.api.azureml.ms;{SUBSCRIPTION_ID};{RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME};{AI_PROJECT_NAME}"
AI_SEARCH_CONNECTION_NAME="{Input your AI Search Connection Name in AI Project}"
OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOY_NAME="gpt-4o" # gpt-4o or gpt-4o-mini
```

### Setting up Azure CLI
We will now implement the AI agent using Azure AI Agent Service, and for service authentication we will use the participants’ Microsoft Entra account. Azure CLI is a simple method to set up account credentials on your development machine. Install it, log in to your Entra tenant, and select your Azure subscription. (Credentials can be obtained via Azure CLI, Azure Powershell, Visual Studio Code, and the managed identities configured on the service. For details, please refer to [this document](https://learn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/dotnet/api/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-dotnet)).

```bash
# Installation
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash

# Verify installation
az version

# Log in to your Azure subscription
az login --use-device-code
## After running this command, you will see a message similar to the following. Open your web browser, navigate to "https://microsoft.com/devicelogin", enter the displayed access code (in this example, "IH4XXXXX"), and log in with your Entra account.
## > To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code IH4XXXXX to authenticate.

# Display the selected Azure subscription and logged in user
az account show

# If the displayed Azure subscription is different from the one you are using, set it as follows
az account set -s "{YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID}"
```

### Setting up Python Virtual Environment
Run the following commands to create a Python virtual environment and install the necessary packages.

```bash
# Move to the src folder
cd src

# Create and activate a Python virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the required Python packages
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Implementing a Program that Uses AI Agent Service (Hello World)
First, implement the basic code to use the Azure AI Agent Service. The code is already implemented in [1.hello_world.py](../src/1.hello_world.py), so run the program with the following command:

```bash
python 1.hello_world.py
```

When you run the code, it will output a file named ```run.json``` (which contains the contents of the processing unit of messages called ```run```) under the directory ```.output/1.hello_world```. Additionally, it will output ```messages.json``` and ```message.json``` containing all messages and the latest message from the assistant. Please refer to these if you are interested.

Let's explain the code.

In the code below, an access client for the Azure AI Project is created by specifying the connection string and its authentication information (currently only Entra authentication via ```DefaultAzureCredential``` is supported). The connection string contains information that identifies the target AI Project (subscription ID, resource group name, resource name). The ```AIProjectClient``` class is provided by the [azure-ai-projects](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-projects/) package.

```py
# Create Azure AI Agent Service client
project = AIProjectClient.from_connection_string(
    conn_str=PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING,
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
)
```

Next, an agent and a thread are created. When creating the agent, specify the model to be used (specifically the deployment name), the agent’s name, and the instructions. The parameter ```instructions``` provides specific directions for the agent’s behavior. A thread is also created; it is used to manage messages, and the agent processes the messages in the thread according to the specified instructions using the model (or tools).

```py
# Create an agent
agent = project.agents.create_agent(
    model=OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOY_NAME,
    name="hello-world-agent",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
)

# Create a thread
thread = project.agents.create_thread()
```

The relationship between the agent, thread, and file structure is as follows:

![Azure AI Agent - Components](images/99.others/ai-agent-components.png)

In the following process, a user message is added to the thread and the thread is processed by the agent. In this case, we use the method ```create_and_process_run``` to start execution and wait until it completes.

```py
# Add a message to the thread
user_message = "Hello my AI agent."
project.agents.create_message(thread_id=thread.id, role="user", content=user_message)

# Process the thread with the agent (wait until the agent finishes processing)
run = project.agents.create_and_process_run(agent_id=agent.id, thread_id=thread.id)
```

Since the agent’s response to the user’s message is stored in the thread, we retrieve the list of messages (```messages```) and obtain the latest message from the assistant (```message```) and then output the content of the agent’s response to the console.

```py
# List messages
messages = project.agents.list_messages(thread_id=thread.id)

# Get and display the latest message from the assistant
message = messages.get_last_text_message_by_role(role="assistant")
print(message.text.value)
```

The code in [1.hello_world.py](../src/1.hello_world.py) successfully creates an AI agent using the Azure AI Agent Service and implements a program for exchanging greetings.

## Implementing a Program that Uses AI Agent Service (RAG with AI Search)
[2.rag.py](../src/2.rag.py)

> [TODO] Add explanation of the code and details of the JSON file (run_steps) output in the ```.output/2.rag``` folder

```bash
python 2.rag.py
```

```py
# Define tools for the agent
ai_search_connection_id = project.connections.get(connection_name=AI_SEARCH_CONNECTION_NAME).id
ai_search = AzureAISearchTool(index_connection_id=ai_search_connection_id, index_name=AI_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME)
toolset = ToolSet()
toolset.add(ai_search)

# Create an agent
agent = project.agents.create_agent(
    model=OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOY_NAME,
    name="rag-agent",
    instructions="""
    - Please respond to user inquiries.
    - For questions related to Azure AI Search, search the connected Azure AI Search index for relevant documents and provide answers based on those documents.
    """,
    toolset=toolset,
)
```

## Implementing a Program that Uses AI Agent Service (Code Interpreter)
[3.code_interpreter.py](../src/3.code_interpreter.py)

> [TODO] Add explanation of the code, details of [materials/sample.csv](../src/materials/sample.csv), and instructions on how to display the image files output in the ```.output/3.code_interpreter``` folder

```bash
python 3.code_interpreter.py
```

```py
# Define tools for the agent
code_interpreter = CodeInterpreterTool()
toolset = ToolSet()
toolset.add(code_interpreter)
```

```py
# Upload a file to the AI project
file = project.agents.upload_file_and_poll(file_path="materials/sample.csv", purpose=FilePurpose.AGENTS)
attachment = MessageAttachment(file_id=file.id, tools=CodeInterpreterTool().definitions)

# Add a message to the thread
user_message = """
The uploaded file is a CSV file that represents the vector sizes of a specific search document when compressed using various “vector compression methods,” “dimensions,” and “data type bit sizes” of Azure AI Search.
From this file, please create a horizontal bar graph to make it easier to understand the vector sizes for each method.
"""
project.agents.create_message(thread_id=thread.id, role="user", content=user_message, attachments=[attachment])
```

```py
# Output generated images
for image_content in messages.image_contents:
    project.agents.save_file(
        file_id=image_content.image_file.file_id,
        target_dir=OUTPUT_DIR,
        file_name=f"{os.path.basename(image_content.image_file.file_id)}.png",
    )
```

## Implementing a Program that Uses AI Agent Service (Streaming Responses)
[4.streaming.py](../src/4.streaming.py)

> [TODO] Add explanation of the code and details of the JSON files (event_types, stream_events.json) output in the ```.output/4.streaming``` folder

```bash
python 4.streaming.py
```

```py
# Process the thread with the agent (receive messages as they are generated)
stream = project.agents.create_stream(thread_id=thread.id, agent_id=agent.id)

# Display the messages as they are generated
event_types = []
stream_events = []
for event_type, data, func_rt in stream.event_handler:
    # Show streaming responses
    if event_type == "thread.message.delta":
        for c in data.delta.content:
            print(c.text.value, end="")
    # Show annotations in the final message
    elif event_type == "thread.message.completed":
        for c in data.content:
            print(c.text.annotations)
    event_types.append(event_type)
    stream_events.append({"event_type": event_type, "data": data.as_dict() if type(data) is not str else None})
```
