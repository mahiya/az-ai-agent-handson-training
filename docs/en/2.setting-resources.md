# 2. Setting Up Azure Resources
Here, we will configure the Azure resources that we have created as follows:
- **Azure AI Search:** Enable the system-assigned managed identity and enable semantic search
- **Azure Storage:** Create a container, upload the PDF files to be registered with AI Search, and assign the 'Storage Blob Data Reader' role to AI Search
- **Azure AI Services:** Assign the 'Azure AI Developer' role to AI Search

For Azure AI Search to utilize Azure Blob Storage and Azure OpenAI Service, you need to specify the endpoint and authentication information. There are two main authentication methods for Azure services: Microsoft Entra authentication (managed identity authentication) and key authentication (password authentication). Although key authentication is easier to use, it does not provide any permission control (anyone with the key has full control), so from a security perspective, it is recommended to use Entra authentication (managed identity authentication) for inter-service authentication. Therefore, in this training, we will basically use Entra authentication.

In this training, because AI Search needs to retrieve PDF files from Blob Storage, it is necessary to assign the appropriate role to AI Search. In addition, as part of AI Search's [Integrated Vectorization Processing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-integrated-vectorization), the process to obtain the embeddings for chunked text when indexing search documents and the process to obtain query embeddings at search execution use Azure OpenAI Service’s text-embedding-3-large model. Therefore, the corresponding roles must be assigned to AI Search. Since the AI Search account does not have a managed identity assigned at the time of creation, we will enable it and assign two roles to that managed identity. To summarize, two roles will be assigned to AI Search for the three interactions shown in the architecture diagram below.

## 2.1 Configuring Azure AI Search

### 2.1.1 Enabling System-Assigned Managed Identity

First, enable the system-assigned managed identity for AI Search.  
Click on ```[Resource groups]``` in the side menu (if it is not displayed, click [All services] > [General] > [Resource groups]).

The resource group page will then be displayed, showing a list of Azure resources belonging to the resource group. The region in which these Azure resources are deployed does not matter. Resource groups are used to organize Azure resources by project or other units, such as for assigning access permissions or for collectively deleting resources when they are no longer needed (deleting a resource group removes all the Azure resources within it).

From the list of Azure resources, click on the name of the AI Search account you created earlier (a resource with the type ```Search Service```).

![Configuring Azure AI Search](images/2.setting-resources/1.ai-search/1.png)

Then, the AI Search account page will be displayed. Click on ```[ID]``` in the settings category in the side menu, set ```[Status]``` (status) to ```[On]```, and click the ```[Save]``` (Save) button.

![Configuring Azure AI Search](images/2.setting-resources/1.ai-search/2.png)

A confirmation window to enable the system-assigned managed identity for the AI Search account will appear; click ```[Yes]``` (Yes) to enable it.

### 2.1.2 Enabling the Semantic Ranker

Next, enable the semantic ranker for AI Search. Even if you do not perform this step, up to 1,000 re-ranking operations (search queries) per month are processed for free; however, if you exceed that limit, errors may occur. To be safe, click the ```[Select Plan]``` button in ```Standard``` to enable the Standard plan (which also processes up to 1,000 operations per month for free).

![Configuring Azure AI Search](images/2.setting-resources/1.ai-search/4.png)

A confirmation window for updating the semantic ranker plan will appear; click ```[はい]``` (Yes) to confirm the update.

## 2.2 Setting Up Azure Storage

Next, create a container in Blob Storage (which is similar to a folder or directory in a file system) and upload the PDF files that will be registered with AI Search. Then, assign the 'Storage Blob Data Reader' role to AI Search to grant read-only access to the Blob data.

### 2.2.1 Uploading PDF Files

As before, display the resource group page and click on the name of the Storage Account you created earlier (a resource with the type ```Storage Account```).

![Configuring Azure Storage](images/2.setting-resources/2.storage/1.png)

The Storage Account page will be displayed. Click on ```[Containers]``` in the Data Storage category in the side menu. When the list of containers is displayed, click the ```[+ Container]``` button in the top menu. Then, enter ```search-docs``` in the ```[Name]``` field and click the ```[Create]``` button.

![Configuring Azure Storage](images/2.setting-resources/2.storage/2.png)

The container "search-docs" has been created. Click on "search-docs" to display the list of Blobs contained within it (in Azure Blob Storage, files are referred to as Blobs).

![Configuring Azure Storage](images/2.setting-resources/2.storage/3.png)

Upload the PDF files that Azure AI Search will process to this container. Download the following three PDF files and then upload them to the container:
1. [index-add-custom-analyzers.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahiya/az-ai-agent-handson-training/refs/heads/main/ai-search/pdfs/index-add-custom-analyzers.pdf)
2. [index-add-scoring-profiles.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahiya/az-ai-agent-handson-training/refs/heads/main/ai-search/pdfs/index-add-scoring-profiles.pdf)
3. [index-ranking-similarity.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahiya/az-ai-agent-handson-training/refs/heads/main/ai-search/pdfs/index-ranking-similarity.pdf)

After downloading the three PDF files, click on ```[Upload]``` in the top menu to display the Blob upload window. Select the three PDF files you downloaded and click the ```[Upload]``` button.

![Configuring Azure Storage](images/2.setting-resources/2.storage/4.png)

Once the upload is complete, a completion notification will appear in the upper right corner of the screen, and the uploaded Blobs will be displayed in the container.

### 2.2.2 Assigning Role to AI Search for Azure Storage

Next, click on ```[Access Control (IAM)]``` in the side menu of the Storage Account page. This will display a screen showing the role (permission) assignments for the Storage Account. Click the ```[+ Add]``` button in the top menu, then click ```[Add role assignment]```.

![Configuring Azure Storage](images/2.setting-resources/2.storage/6.png)

A window for assigning a role to the Storage Account will appear. First, choose the role to assign. Since there are many roles available, type ```blob``` in the search box to filter them. Once ```[Storage BLOB Data Reader]``` appears in the list, click it and then click the ```[Next]``` button.

![Configuring Azure Storage](images/2.setting-resources/2.storage/7.png)

Next, select the target for the role assignment. First, under ```Assign access to```, check ```[Managed Identity]``` and click ```[+ Select members]```. A window will appear on the right side to choose the managed identity to which the role should be assigned. Under ```Managed Identity```, select ```[Search Service]```, then choose the displayed name of the AI Search account you created earlier, and click the ```[Select]``` button.

## 2.3 Configuring Azure AI Service

Finally, assign the 'Azure AI Developer' role on the AI Service Account (the account used for Azure OpenAI Service) to AI Search, thereby granting access for using AI models (gpt-4o/gpt-4o-mini and text-embedding-3-large).

As before, display the resource group page and click on the name of the AI Service Account that was created when setting up the Azure AI Hub (a resource with the type ```Azure AI services```).

![Configuring Azure AI Service](images/2.setting-resources/3.ai-services/1.png)

The AI Service Account page will be displayed. Click on ```[Access control (IAM)]``` in the side menu to view the role (permission) assignments for this account. Click the ```[+ Add]``` button in the top menu, then click ```[Add role assignment]```.

![Configuring Azure AI Service](images/2.setting-resources/3.ai-services/2.png)

A window for assigning a role to the account will appear. First, choose the role to assign by typing ```Azure AI Developer``` in the search box to filter the options. When ```[Azure AI Developer]``` appears, click it and then click the ```[次へ]``` (Next) button.

![Configuring Azure AI Service](images/2.setting-resources/3.ai-services/3.png)

Next, select the target for the role assignment. Under ```Assign access to```, check ```[Managed Identity]``` and click ```[+ Select members]```. A window will appear on the right side to choose the managed identity to which the role should be assigned. Under ```Managed Identity```, select ```[Search Service]```, then choose the displayed name of the AI Search account you created earlier, and click the ```[Select]``` button.
