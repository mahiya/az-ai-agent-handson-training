# 5. Additional Training
Below, we have provided additional training exercises for those who have spare time.

## 5.1 Implementing Multi-Agent Systems with the Semantic Kernel Agent Framework
First, run the following command to install the [required package](https://pypi.org/project/semantic-kernel):
```bash
pip install semantic-kernel==1.28.0
```

Next, navigate to the [src](../../src) directory and try running [5.multi-agent.py](../../src/5.multi-agent.py) using the following command:
```bash
python 5.multi-agent.py
```

You should see output similar to the following:
```bash
$ python 5.multi-agent.py 
AuthorRole.USER: 'a slogan for a new line of electric cars.'
AuthorRole.ASSISTANT - CopyWriter: '"Charge Aheadâ€”Leave the Gas Behind."'
AuthorRole.ASSISTANT - ArtDirector: 'This slogan is acceptable to print.'
AuthorRole.ASSISTANT - CopyWriter: '"Powered by Tomorrow, Driven by You."'
AuthorRole.ASSISTANT - ArtDirector: 'This slogan is acceptable to print.'
AuthorRole.ASSISTANT - CopyWriter: '"Silent Streets, Bold Moves."'
AuthorRole.ASSISTANT - ArtDirector: 'This slogan is acceptable to print.'
AuthorRole.ASSISTANT - CopyWriter: '"Drive the Future, One Charge at a Time."'
AuthorRole.ASSISTANT - ArtDirector: 'While the idea is strong, the phrase could be refined for clarity and impact. Consider emphasizing the unique benefits of the electric vehicles and making it more concise. Focus on what makes this line of cars stand out and resonate emotionally with the audience.'
AuthorRole.ASSISTANT - CopyWriter: '"Charge. Drive. Repeat."'
AuthorRole.ASSISTANT - ArtDirector: 'This slogan is acceptable to print.'
```

This program utilizes the [Semantic Kernel Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/?pivots=programming-language-python) to address the user's request by facilitating communication between agents operating on multiple Azure AI Agent Services with different roles through the functionality of [Agent Group Chat](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/examples/example-agent-collaboration?pivots=programming-language-python).

In this instance, in response to the user's request to "generate a slogan for a new line of electric cars," the 'Art Director Agent' and the 'Copywriter Agent' engage in multiple rounds of interaction until they meet the termination condition (ApprovalTerminationStrategy), ultimately generating the response.

Once you have successfully run this program, try changing the roles of the agents and the user's request, and experiment with the operation of the multi-agent system.
